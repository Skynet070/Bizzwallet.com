                                            <li>    (9) I understand that I cannot under any circumstances incur any unauthorized debt, expenses or obligation on behalf of Co-operative. </li>

                                                                <li>     (14) As a member I must equally assist the co-operative to raise more funds by contributing my five hundred Naira every month. </li>

                                                                            <li>   (17) I understand that the Co-operative does not use any other means to retrieve back money from the debtors who access a loan or purchase an item with 50% up-front payment, other than through Remit standing order by the client, hence the borrower/or buyer must be a civil servant on regular salary either from the state or the Federal Government. </li>

                                                                                    <li>   (19) The co-operative, its parent or affiliated companies, directors, officers, shareholders, employees and assigns (collectively referred to as officers) shall not be liable for, and I release the co-operative and its officers from all claims or cause of action relating to the Agreement.
